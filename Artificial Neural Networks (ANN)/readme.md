# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
* Neural Networks : are designed to mimic human brains 
* Neurons : smallest unit of NN that are responsible for input, processing, output

  ## Neural Networks
  * Neural networks are made of input neuron, hidden layers and output neurons
  * Each input neuron represents a feature and has weight and bias given to it
  * hidden layers add a lot of power as inout layers neurons are feeded to them in various combination of features
  * these hidden neurons have acivation function that allows the signals to pass based on their importance
  * after multiple combinations and passes it finally reaches the output neuron
  * actual and calculated values are compared and cost function is calculated
  * then weights are adjusted backwards in order to improve the accuracy so as to minimise the co function
  * one round through the whole dataset is called one **_epoch_**
