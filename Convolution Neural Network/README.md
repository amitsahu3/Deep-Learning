# Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the extended version of artificial neural networks (ANN) which is predominantly used to extract the feature from the grid-like matrix dataset. For example visual datasets like images or videos where data patterns play an extensive role.
# Problem
**Classify an image as cat or dog using CNN**
## CNN architecture
Convolutional Neural Network consists of multiple layers like the input layer, Convolutional layer, Pooling layer, and fully connected layers.

The Convolutional layer applies filters to the input image to extract features, the Pooling layer downsamples the image to reduce computation, and the fully connected layer makes the final prediction. The network learns the optimal filters through backpropagation and gradient descent.
## Problem : 
Given the bank customers dataset , a high churn rate is observed(customers leaving), look into the dataset to assess and analyse it.
Construct a **_geodemographic segmentation_** model to tell the bank which customers are at the highest risk of leaving


  ## Neural Networks
  * Neural networks are made of input neuron, hidden layers and output neurons
  * Each input neuron represents a feature and has weight and bias given to it
  * hidden layers add a lot of power as inout layers neurons are feeded to them in various combination of features
  * these hidden neurons have acivation function that allows the signals to pass based on their importance
  * after multiple combinations and passes it finally reaches the output neuron
  * actual and calculated values are compared and cost function is calculated
  * then weights are adjusted backwards in order to improve the accuracy so as to minimise the co function
  * one round through the whole dataset is called one **_epoch_**
